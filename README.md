# MichaelJHTaggart's Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why?

I have built a few portfolio's, but I wanted one that really showed my skills as a web developer. I wanted a portfolio that didn't only serve as a place for recruiters to stop by and be wowed by my skills, but I thought this should also be a place where people can actually see what I do, and can pay for my services.

This project will be a work in progress over the next couple of months. There are a lot of features to implement.

I decided to not implement tools like bootstrap, material ui, ect. Instead I built out all of these myself.
